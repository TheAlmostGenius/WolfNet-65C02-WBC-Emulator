# WolfNet 65C02 WorkBench Computer Emulator
Emulator for the WolfNet 65C02 WorkBench Computer.

Written in C# and built using the .NET Framework
so that it can be built on more systems. Feel free to 
make adaptations to the software so it can emulate a
6502 OR 65816 system but you are not allowed to charge
for the software or ANY additions/ammendments to it.
